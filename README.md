Hey! I'm Katrina - a passionate technologist, educator, and problem solver with a keen interest in leveraging software to enhance learning experiences. I graduated from UBC in 2021 with a B.A, majoring in computer science, and minoring in psychology. To combine my technical abilities and desire to inspire others, I recently completed a Bachelor's in Education (B.Ed) to bring coding skills & better digital learning experiences into the classroom.

üíª As a software developer, I thrive on building user-centric solutions and crafting clean, efficient code. My experience spans full stack web development, UX design, and collaborating on cross-functional teams.

üçé As an educator, I'm committed to transforming classrooms into dynamic, hands-on learning environments. I embrace innovative approaches, often rooting lessons in SEL practices that are place-based and encourage critical thinking.
